## About The Project

Hi, I'm Siya and this is DoodleUI. It's my project where I combine my love for doodle art with web development. In this library, I've created a bunch of components using React.js and SCSS. They're simple, fun, and have that doodle style I really like.

I made DoodleUI because I noticed there weren't many resources for this kind of design. It's built with React, Rollup & Storybook, which I found to be a great combination for this work. The project isn't open for contributions at the moment, but feel free to let me know about any bugs or things you think would be cool to add.

DoodleUI is something I'm sharing on specific terms, so if you're interested in using it, just check with me first.

## Built With

In building DoodleUI, I've utilized a mix of technologies that I find effective and enjoyable to work with. The core is built on React, giving the components their interactive edge. For styling, I've leaned into Sass for its flexibility. Typescript is in play too, ensuring more robust coding. Rollup helps bundle everything neatly, and Storybook makes it easier to visualize and test the components. Together, these technologies bring DoodleUI to life.
